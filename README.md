## Approach

## Component-driven design: 
- Split into Tab, TabList, TabPanels, and TabPanel for composability.

## Styling: 
- Written in SCSS with design tokens, no external CSS frameworks.

## Variants: 
- Pill and Underline supported via variant prop.

## Badges: 
- Added as a separate component and injected via props.

## Accessibility: 
- Added ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support.

## Testing: 
- Implemented with Vitest + Testing Library to verify UI behavior and accessibility.

## Demo & Storybook: 
- Both a raw React demo (App.tsx + index.tsx) and Storybook stories are included.

## Figma File

The design reference is available in the Figma file: https://www.figma.com/design/OclakAGLSXDoMKLFvwLNMP/%F0%9F%92%BB-Design-System-Home-Test---Tabs-Component?node-id=0-1&t=4pG7NN6HKxgxroDz-1

## Notes
- CSS state ‚Äúhacks‚Äù (storybook-states.scss) were used to freeze visual states (hover, focus, active) for design review. These are not used in production, only in Storybook for Figma parity.

- The solution is fully reusable and can be integrated into larger design systems.
